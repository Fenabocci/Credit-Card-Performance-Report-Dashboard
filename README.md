## Analytics Insights

1. **Transaction Amount Trend**
   - The transaction amount follows a cyclical pattern, with peaks in April and August, reaching highs of nearly **$4.5M** in these months.
   - Noticeable dips in February and December suggest lower spending, likely due to seasonality.

   **Insight**: The surge in transaction amounts during April and August could correlate with tax season and vacation periods. Tailored marketing campaigns could capitalize on these peaks.

2. **Transaction Volume Stability**
   - Monthly transaction volumes remain consistent, averaging **55K to 60K**. May has the highest transaction volume.

   **Insight**: The stability in transaction volume, despite fluctuations in amount, indicates a loyal customer base. Efforts to engage and retain these customers are likely yielding steady results.

3. **Expenditure Type Analysis**
   - The top expenditure categories by transaction amount are **Bills**, **Entertainment**, and **Fuel**. Bills alone contribute nearly **25%** of the total transaction amount.

   **Insight**: Consumers primarily use their credit cards for essential spending. There is potential to drive usage in other categories, like **Travel** and **Food**, by offering targeted incentives.

4. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
   - The total CAC is **$972.94K**, equating to approximately **$96.25** per acquired customer.

   **Insight**: Reducing the CAC by focusing on more cost-effective marketing strategies or referral programs could increase profitability.

5. **Interest Earned**
   - The company earned **$7.84M** in interest on credit card balances, representing a key revenue stream.

   **Insight**: Analysis of customers contributing the most interest earned could help segment users and refine offerings for different customer tiers.

## Recommendations

   - Leverage transaction peaks in April and August by offering promotional campaigns or rewards programs during these months to maximize spending.

2. **Increase Spend in Non-Essential Categories**
   - Encourage more spending in categories like **Travel** and **Food** by providing tailored offers, cashback, or higher loyalty points for these expenditures.

3. **Lower Customer Acquisition Cost**
   - Implement referral programs or digital marketing targeting high-value customer segments to reduce acquisition costs and improve conversion rates.

4. **Focus on Retention Strategies**
   - Introduce personalized loyalty programs based on user spending patterns, especially for high-frequency users in categories like **Bills** and **Fuel**, to boost retention and overall transaction amounts.

5. **Analyze Credit Risk**
   - Regularly monitor customers carrying over balances to minimize default risks while maximizing interest earned. Offering structured repayment plans could improve long-term financial health for both the business and customers.
